Feature: dashboard-requests-metrics-display
    As a admin I need to validate the accuracy of dashboard metrics for processed files in order to confirm that the solution works as expected

    Background:
        Given I am logged into the ui
        And I have navigated to the Analytics page


    @TEST-
    Scenario Outline: The file risk count is updated for every file processed based on the outcome
        Given I have confirmed the current risks counts for '<risk>'
        When I process a '<file>' through the icap server
        Then the risk sector '<risk>' is available and shows the count updated by '<increasedValue>'
        Examples:
            | file              | risk         | increasedValue |
            | Safe_file         | Safe         | 1              |
            | Malicious_file    | Blocked      | 1              |
            | Malware_file      | Dangerous    | 1              |
            | Unclassified_file | Unclassified | 1              |


    Scenario Outline: The count of files requests processed is updated based on processing status
        Given I have confirmed the concurrent counts of total files requests processed
        When I process a '<file>' through the icap server with an outcome as <fileOutcome>
        Then the Total Files processed is increased by <TFUpdateByValue>
        And the Total icap requests is increased by <TRUpdateByValue>
        And the max files per second processed is increased by <MFUpdateByValue>
        Examples:
            | file              | fileOutcome  | TFUpdateByValue | TRUpdateByValue | MFUpdateByValue |
            | Safe_file         | Safe         | 1               | 1               | 1               |
            | Malicious_file    | Blocked      | 0               | 1               | 0               |
            | Malware_file      | Dangerous    | 0               | 1               | 0               |
            | Unclassified_file | Unclassified | 0               | 1               | 1               |
