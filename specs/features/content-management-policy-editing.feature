Feature: Content Management Policy Editing
    As a admin I need to validate that policy content flags can be edited in order to confirm that the solution works as expected

    Background:
        Given I am logged into the portal
        Given I am on current policy screen


    @TEST-153
    Scenario: A user selecting the "Current Policy" in the navigation panel will be taken to the current policy page
        When I click on Current Policy in the navigation panel
        Then I am taken to the current policy page


    @TEST-188
    Scenario Outline: A user can cancel any updates that they have done to the policy by pressing cancel
        When I change one of the <ContentFlags> for required file types <fileType> to <FlagType>
        When I press the Cancel button
        Then the Current policy defaults to the latest saved policy
        Examples:
            | fileType   | ContentFlags    | FlagType |
            | word       | embeddedFiles   | sanitise |



    @TEST-155
    Scenario Outline: I can edit policy content flags
        When I change one of the <ContentFlags> for required file types <fileType> to <FlagType>
        When I press the Save button
        Then <ContentFlags> for required file types <fileType> is set to <FlagType>
        Examples:`
            | fileType   | ContentFlags         | FlagType |
            | word       | embeddedFiles        | sanitise |
